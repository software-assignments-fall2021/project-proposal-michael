### Constellation: A Browser-based Astronomy Tracker

### What and why?

This semester, I hope to build a browser-based application to track the orbit of satellites and other orbital bodies (e.g. things like the ISS and more, time permitting). Recreational astronomy is shockingly difficult to get into for first timers seeking to do anything more than just point a telescope up and guess. Especially to hobbyists who want to use something like radio and communicate with orbiting satellites, options for finding out which satellites are where in a non-overwhelming manner are scarce. This solution would provide those aspiring astronomers with a clean and simple tool to enable their exploration of outer space, and thus making space more accessible for everybody.

### For whom?

This application is intended for casual hobbyists interested in space, or people with an interest in space but no prior experience with astronomy. More experienced veterans of the field will likely have no direct need for an application that prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, but they may find interest in the tool as a means of introducing friends to the hobby as well.

### How?

The user will see a world map with a few objects' orbital paths mapped out (e.g. they may see the ISS currently over the Atlantic Ocean, flying over the USA a few hours in the future). They will be able to customize what they see (which satellites, planets, etc). Using a simple search bar and/or check box list. They will also be able to swap to a night-sky perspective, both to see the approximate trajectory of the celestial body in question, as well as see an approximation of the night sky from that location (for stargazing). They will be able to save their preferences for satellites/planets/etc. to track, and may receive notifications prior to optimal viewing windows.

### Scope

This project splits very easily into two sub-groups: tracking satellites, and tracking stars. While this project may be slightly ambitious in its multiple functionalities, its inherent modularity will allow for extremely easy estimates of effort, since it has an extremely clear "half-way point" in the project. Once this point is reached, gauging scope will be trivial, and increasing or decreasing scope to accomodate will be simple. Regardless of all this, however, I still believe the project in its current form is of proper scope for the class. It has sufficiently complex functionalities so as to take time to learn and implement, but not so much functionality as to take an extreme amount of time (over a semester) to complete.
